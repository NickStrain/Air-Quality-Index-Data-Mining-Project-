üåç Air Quality Analysis Project
üìñ Introduction

Air quality has been one of the most significant environmental issues throughout modern history. The industrial revolution, recent population growth, and infrastructure development have led to increasing concentrations of pollutants in the Earth‚Äôs atmosphere.

Research surrounding air quality focuses on measuring and understanding the pollutants that we release into the air we breathe. Getting a better understanding of how they are released, and how we interact with them, gives us a better understanding of the effects on long-term health, the environment, and the economy.

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), an estimated 7 million premature deaths occur annually due to air pollution. The importance of this subject stems from the fact that everyone is affected by air quality, and developments discovered through this work have the potential to benefit everyone.

Communities, governments, and corporations all stand to benefit from improvements in air quality analysis. The applications of the work are varied, with a high potential to be of use in areas we have not yet explored. In addition, understanding air quality patterns can inform city planning, disaster preparedness, and policy design. By focusing on air quality analysis, our research contributes to a growing global effort to improve quality of life and build more sustainable futures.

üë• Stakeholders

The issue of air quality touches a wide range of stakeholders, from individuals and families to entire industries and national governments.

Most vulnerable groups: children, the elderly, and individuals with pre-existing respiratory conditions.

Healthcare systems: increasing hospitalizations from pollutants drive up costs and stress resources.

Pollution sources: while individuals contribute, corporations are the main drivers of air pollution.

Advocacy groups & researchers: rely on air quality data for systemic change.

Technology companies: innovations in monitoring, sensors, predictive modeling, and clean energy play a major role.

The scope of air quality means that nearly every sector of society has some level of involvement or responsibility. The implications are global in scale but often felt most acutely at the local and community level.

‚ö†Ô∏è Current Challenges

The most obvious challenge that the industry currently faces is climate change.

Pollutants released into the atmosphere, largely due to human activity, drive climate change.

While significant progress has been made in measurement and regulation, room for improvement remains.

Existing Solutions

EPA National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) set acceptable pollutant levels.

Data is collected through monitoring stations + satellite data.

Remaining Gaps

Coverage gaps in resource-limited areas.

Missing information restricts the ability to anticipate high pollutant concentrations.

Highlights the need for data science, machine learning, and open data to generate actionable insights.

This issue lies at the intersection of government, policy, individual behavior, and corporate activity, requiring combined efforts from all parties.

üéØ Project Goals

Our project is designed to explore opportunities by conducting an air quality analysis using modern data-driven methods.

Objectives:

Evaluate air quality trends.

Identify hotspots.

Highlight correlations between pollution and health/socioeconomic factors.

Support arguments for climate action.

Data Sources:

EPA

WHO

Open-source datasets

Focus Area:

Colorado (with comparisons at the national level).

Methods (planned):

Exploratory and statistical analysis.

Visualizations to reveal spatial and temporal patterns.

Machine learning models for predictive analysis.

Comparative studies (urban vs rural, policy impact).

üõ†Ô∏è Skills & Practice

This project serves as practice for:

Data analytics

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Data cleaning & data mining

Domain knowledge development

By examining the intersection of related domains, our project adds a new perspective.

üå± Impact & Outcomes

We aim to present both descriptive results and actionable recommendations, such as:

Identifying regions needing improved monitoring.

Highlighting high/low risk areas.

Developing models to predict at-risk areas.

Ensuring clean air is a shared responsibility. Though obstacles remain, this project represents:

A step toward applying data-driven techniques to climate challenges.

A way to strengthen our skills as data scientists.

‚ú® Ultimately, this project is a small but meaningful contribution to the global effort to combat climate change through data and innovation.
